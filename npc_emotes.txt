2334	1292	3	1	pitches forward, cracking the ground below hid fallen body.
2335	1293	1	1	descends upon its foe with a flurry of attacks.

2343	1298	2	1	 stumbles as black blood floods from the wound at her side.  She crumples, but continues to twitch and jerk, causing spatters of her own black blood to smear across the floor.  You gaze, horrified, at her gaping wound and realize there is a sword hilt lodged inside of her still warm corpse.  For a moment you think the hilt is moving, but then struggle to keep from retching as you realize the body is filled with maggots.
2344	1299	2	1	 begins to shake uncontrollably as his armor begins to crack.  `No! Oshiruk is invincible! The Wyrm holds no sway over me!`  His voice begins to trail off as the shivering of the armor multiplies.  With a cataclysmic explosion the shards of the armor explode, sending ripples of energy through the canyon.  When you turn back to look you see the charred remnants of what once was the mighty Oshiruk lying on the ground.\

2345	1299	1	1	 roars loudly. `Mortals are so predictably idiotic!  Did you really think you could destroy me?!?! Shiver in fear for Oshiruk the devourer has returned!
